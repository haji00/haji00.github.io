            <p>
                My name is Sepidah. I am an <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> student in Algonquin College. I started my program on May 10<sup>th</sup>, 2021. When I immigrated to Canada, I realized that I had to take a different path to achieve my goals. Furthermore, learning a new language and a totally different culture have been my biggest challenges over the past few years, although I never let them become obstacles to my success.

                In my opinion, <em>success</em> is like a house in which education is its foundation and having a good foundation can be counted as the basis of a promising career. Each person has different desires in life; therefore, they can each have their definition of success. From my perspective, success is in having a happy family, a reasonable amount of wealth, well-established social status, and having self-satisfaction. Some of these principles cannot be achieved unless I accomplish comprehensive self-awareness, learn about my strengths, and figure out areas that need to be developed.
